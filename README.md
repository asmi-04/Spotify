# 🎵 Spotify Clone (HTML & CSS)

## 📌 Description
This is a basic front-end clone of Spotify built entirely using HTML and CSS.  
It mimics the layout and design of Spotify’s web player interface with a sidebar navigation menu, playlist section, and a footer music player.  
The goal of this project is to practice CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid while recreating a modern music app interface.
